# Camera Experiments in C#
üìπ C# Functionality for connecting to various\* Wildlife / Security Cameras and downloading their recording files.

\*Currently only connects to the **Ceyomur** cameras, including the **Ceyomur CY95 Solar 4K Trail Camera**. 
 
‚ûï More camera makes and models will be added over time

## How to use

‚úèÔ∏è Modify *Settings.json* to suit your setup.

`localFilePath` - set this to a folder where files can be downloaded.

*For Ceyomur cameras..*  
`WifiSSID` - set this to the Wifi SSID of your camera.  
`WifiPassword` - set this to the Wifi Password of your camera.  
`BluetoothDeviceId` - set this to the Bluetooth Device ID of your camera.  

## üêß Linux (Experimental)

To run, you may need to start `NetworkManager` first.

`sudo systemctl start NetworkManager`

**Wifi** requires `nmcli`, **Bluetooth** requires `hcitool` and `gatttool`.

You will need to add execute permissions on the two script files, and the main executable.

`chmod +x Scripts/BluetoothLinux.sh`  
`chmod +x Scripts/WifiLinux.sh`  

`chmod +x CameraExperiments`  

Then to execute, run:  

`sudo ./CameraExperiments`
